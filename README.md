# 🚀 PyAI-Challenge30 – 30 Python + AI Projects in 30 Days

Welcome to **PyAI-Challenge30**, a self-paced coding challenge where I aim to build and share **30 AI + Python projects in 30 days**. The goal is to level up daily through consistent practice, learning, and creation.

---

## 🔥 Why This Challenge?

The best way to learn is by building. This challenge is designed to:
- Strengthen Python fundamentals and AI/ML concepts
- Build real-world mini-projects every day
- Improve problem-solving, documentation, and Git/GitHub skills
- Share learnings openly with the developer and AI community

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Flask / Streamlit (for web projects)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each project is stored in its own folder (e.g., `Day1_BasicCalculator`), containing:
- `day1.py`: the source code
- `README.md`: project-specific overview
